  Project Overview

This project provides a unified analytical view of:

- Economic performance (GDP growth, inflation)  
- Credit dynamics (credit growth and risk exposure)  
- Composite risk scoring  
- Expansion capacity estimation  
- Portfolio allocation across multiple countries  
- Stress testing under adverse economic scenarios  

The core objective is to bridge the gap between macroeconomic conditions and credit decision-making, enabling institutions to evaluate risk, simulate scenarios, and optimize capital deployment through a single analytical interface.

  Key Objectives

- Translate risk metrics into practical expansion strategies (Defensive / Moderate / Aggressive)  
- Support multi-market portfolio optimization based on risk-adjusted returns  
- Perform economic stress testing to estimate potential credit losses  
- Provide executive-level summaries to assist strategic decision-making  

  Methodology – Three-Layer Framework

  Strategic Layer (Planning & Risk Logic)

- Define objectives for credit risk assessment and expansion decisions  
- Select core macro-financial indicators (GDP growth, inflation, credit growth)  
- Design a unified Risk Scoring framework (0–100)  
- Define expansion strategies and portfolio allocation logic based on risk-adjusted returns  

 ⚙️ Technical Layer (Data & Modeling)

- Macroeconomic indicators are sourced from the World Bank  
- Data is cleaned and structured into country–year time series  
- A 5-year analysis window is applied for consistent financial measurement  
- GDP growth and credit growth are calculated  
- Missing values are handled, features normalized, and appropriate statistical methods selected  
- Key indicators are combined into a unified Risk Score (0–100)

Tools & Technologies:

- Python – core programming language  
- Streamlit – interactive dashboard development  
- Pandas & NumPy – data processing and numerical analysis  
- Plotly – financial and analytical visualizations  


  Execution Layer (Implementation & Decision Support)

- Initial dashboard structure is designed and data quality validated  
- Indicators are analyzed using the Larger Market Formula for comparison  
- Expansion strategies are derived and capital allocated across countries to balance return and risk  
- Results are integrated into an interactive dashboard  
- Economic stress scenarios are simulated  
- Final technical and visual tuning ensures alignment between analytics and presentation  


  Key Decision Insights

The platform supports decision-making across three core areas:

 1. Overall Market Assessment  
Integrated evaluation using GDP growth, inflation, and credit growth to assess economic health and risk.

 2. Defining a Safe Expansion Range  
Estimates expansion size based on partial capital allocation (not full deployment), enabling balanced growth while preserving capital.

 3. Intelligent Capital Allocation  

Recommends multi-market allocation to:

- Reduce overall exposure  
- Improve risk-adjusted returns  
- Enhance diversification  

Multiple economic scenarios are evaluated to provide a forward-looking perspective for proactive risk management.


 💎 Business Value

- Comprehensive market assessment using multiple indicators  
- Controlled credit expansion that preserves capital  
- Improved portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns  
- Forward-looking insights through scenario testing  
- Conversion of macroeconomic data into actionable recommendations  

 📝 Notes
This project is informed by prior study of core financial analytics concepts including scenario analysis, investment evaluation, and financial decision-making, supported by foundational material from *Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation* and *Analysis of Financial Data*.

🏁 Project Conclusion
This project integrates macroeconomic analysis, credit risk assessment, and portfolio optimization into a unified interactive dashboard.  
It enables data-driven expansion and capital allocation decisions through structured risk scoring and scenario analysis.  
Overall, the platform shifts decision-making from reactive responses to a proactive, analytics-driven approach, improving financial sustainability and investment quality.

 Transparency Note

This project was fully developed by the author, with AI tools used selectively to support documentation, idea structuring, and presentation refinement.
Any AI-assisted coding represents less than 20% of the overall project development.

All analytical logic, system design, data selection, and decision frameworks were independently implemented.
