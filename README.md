  Project Overview

This project provides a unified analytical view of:

- Economic performance (GDP growth, inflation)  
- Credit dynamics (credit growth and risk exposure)  
- Composite risk scoring  
- Expansion capacity estimation  
- Portfolio allocation across multiple countries  
- Stress testing under adverse economic scenarios  

The core objective is to bridge the gap between macroeconomic conditions and credit decision-making, enabling institutions to evaluate risk, simulate scenarios, and optimize capital deployment through a single analytical interface.

 🎯 Key Objectives

- Translate risk metrics into practical expansion strategies (Defensive / Moderate / Aggressive)  
- Support multi-market portfolio optimization based on risk-adjusted returns  
- Perform economic stress testing to estimate potential credit losses  
- Provide executive-level summaries to assist strategic decision-making  

 🧭 Methodology – Three-Layer Framework

 🧠 Strategic Layer (Planning & Risk Logic)

- Define objectives for credit risk assessment and expansion decisions  
- Select core macro-financial indicators (GDP growth, inflation, credit growth)  
- Design a unified Risk Scoring framework (0–100)  
- Define expansion strategies and portfolio allocation logic based on risk-adjusted returns  

 ⚙️ Technical Layer (Data & Modeling)

- Macroeconomic indicators are sourced from the World Bank  
- Data is cleaned and structured into country–year time series  
- A 5-year analysis window is applied for consistent financial measurement  
- GDP growth and credit growth are calculated  
- Missing values are handled, features normalized, and appropriate statistical methods selected  
- Key indicators are combined into a unified Risk Score (0–100)

Tools & Technologies:

- Python – core programming language  
- Streamlit – interactive dashboard development  
- Pandas & NumPy – data processing and numerical analysis  
- Plotly – financial and analytical visualizations  


 🚀 Execution Layer (Implementation & Decision Support)

- Initial dashboard structure is designed and data quality validated  
- Indicators are analyzed using the Larger Market Formula for comparison  
- Expansion strategies are derived and capital allocated across countries to balance return and risk  
- Results are integrated into an interactive dashboard  
- Economic stress scenarios are simulated  
- Final technical and visual tuning ensures alignment between analytics and presentation  


 🧠 Key Decision Insights

The platform supports decision-making across three core areas:

 1. Overall Market Assessment  
Integrated evaluation using GDP growth, inflation, and credit growth to assess economic health and risk.

 2. Defining a Safe Expansion Range  
Estimates expansion size based on partial capital allocation (not full deployment), enabling balanced growth while preserving capital.

 3. Intelligent Capital Allocation  

Recommends multi-market allocation to:

- Reduce overall exposure  
- Improve risk-adjusted returns  
- Enhance diversification  

Multiple economic scenarios are evaluated to provide a forward-looking perspective for proactive risk management.


 💎 Business Value

- Comprehensive market assessment using multiple indicators  
- Controlled credit expansion that preserves capital  
- Improved portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns  
- Forward-looking insights through scenario testing  
- Conversion of macroeconomic data into actionable recommendations  

 📝 Notes
This project is informed by prior study of core financial analytics concepts including scenario analysis, investment evaluation, and financial decision-making, supported by foundational material from *Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation* and *Analysis of Financial Data*.

🏁 Project Conclusion
This project integrates macroeconomic analysis, credit risk assessment, and portfolio optimization into a unified interactive dashboard.  
It enables data-driven expansion and capital allocation decisions through structured risk scoring and scenario analysis.  
Overall, the platform shifts decision-making from reactive responses to a proactive, analytics-driven approach, improving financial sustainability and investment quality.
